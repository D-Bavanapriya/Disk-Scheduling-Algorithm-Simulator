# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator
The Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator is a web-based tool designed to visualize and simulate different disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It allows users to input disk requests, select a scheduling algorithm, and simulate how the disk head will process those requests. The simulator supports popular algorithms such as:

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
SCAN
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
LOOK
C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)
Users can enter the initial head position, disk request queue, and the maximum disk size. The simulator then computes the total seek time and dynamically displays the head movements on a graphical interface, providing a step-by-step visualization of the selected algorithm. This tool helps users understand the efficiency and behavior of different disk scheduling techniques by comparing their seek times and execution order.
